## Analyzing bank customer churn using SQL

### Project Description
This project is dedicated to analyzing bank customer churn based on a dataset containing detailed customer information such as demographics, financials, and behavioral characteristics.
The target variable is binary and indicates whether the customer left the bank (closed the account) or remained an active customer.
All analysis was performed using SQL to identify key factors influencing churn and generate valuable business insights.

### Project Objectives
- Conduct exploratory data analysis (EDA) to understand the data structure
- Demonstrate the use of SQL for data processing, aggregation, and analysis ( [SQL](https://github.com/VasylBihari/Project_SQL_Bank_Churn_Modeling/blob/main/sql/sql_scripts.sql) )
- Create a dashboard in Google Sheets with visualization of the received data [Dashboard](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1naJDnQopu5NcWmKVYYdYg4hIfE12_DxDhzuTZibFxXE/edit?gid=2079650780#gid=2079650780)

### Dataset
